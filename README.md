Specflow is amazing and does what it says, but after working with it over the last few months I found that the code generation strategy was actually getting in the way of the underlying test framework (MsTest|NUnit|Xunit) instead of complimenting it. Something as simple as standard output logging with xunit required modifying the generated code. I also feared a refactor with the re-use of bindings preffering C# re-use over specflow re-use.
